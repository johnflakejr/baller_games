        Am I great at fantasy football?  No. In fact:
        <ol>
          <li>
            I've lost to my two year-old in both years he's played in our family league. 
          </li>
          <li>
            I traded AWAY Cooper Kupp last year for Dalvin Cook in one league.  
          </li>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlucky? Maybe? Foolish?  Absolutely. 
      </p>
        You don't want to read a ton of text, so let me just say this: I love fantasy football
        and I love the show.  My wife introduced me to your podcast a few years ago and I've been 
        a weekly listener ever since. I would love to be a part of the listener league.  Enjoy the
        games I've created for you in exchange for considering me for a spot!!!
